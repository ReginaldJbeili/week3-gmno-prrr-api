## User Journey

* An app for people who are into cats and would like to learn what breed they match themselves. 
* User can fill in the form with some basic personality questions.
* User must enter a valid input data. If the input is left blank the error message will be displayed.
* Once the user submits the form he or she gets description and GIF image about corresponding breed. 

## Requirements 
- [ ] at least two APIs using the XMLHttpRequest method
- [ ] a clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme.
- [ ] a well-considered architecture for your app
- [ ] code: break your JavaScript down into small functions with a clear input and output;

- [ ] design: aim for a responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] accessibility
- [ ] take appropriate measures when it comes to concealing private information
